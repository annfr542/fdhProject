                <h1>About the project</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>This project aims to observe how a railway user of the middle of the 19th century
                    could travel between some cities such as Paris, Lyon, Geneva or Marseille
                    in regards to nowadays. Several aspects of the trip have been looked into, 
                    the journey path, the schedules of the trains and the price of the tickets.
                    All of these informations come from a single document that contains both a 
                    timetable and a map of the railway network and have been computed into a program,
                        so one can look for a trip and find easily all the informations needed. This
                        whole project puts into perspective how the evolution of transports, in this 
                        particular example trains, have made the world much more connected and
                        travelling much easier.
